# water-reminder
The app starts by asking the user how much water they want to drink in a day. The user can enter a value in ounces or milliliters. Once the user has entered their goal, the app starts a timer. Every hour, the app will send a notification to the user reminding them to drink water. The notification will also show the user how much water they have drunk so far.

The app also has a settings page where the user can customize the app. The user can choose how often they want to receive notifications, and they can also choose to turn off notifications for certain hours of the day.

The water reminder app is a simple but effective way to stay hydrated..........
